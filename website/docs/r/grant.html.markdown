# turbot_grant

The `Turbot Grant` resource adds support for grants in Turbot Guardrails. Turbot Guardrails grant presents a cleaner and more explicit separation of duties on how users are managed in Turbot Guardrails.

## Example Usage

**Creating Your First Grant**

```hcl
resource "turbot_grant" "test_grant" {
  resource = "tmod:@turbot/turbot#/"
  type     = "tmod:@turbot/aws#/permission/types/aws"
  level    = "tmod:@turbot/turbot-iam#/permission/levels/superuser"
  identity = turbot_profile.test.id
}
```
The above example creates a grant called `test_grant`. It is important to understand that a grant is for a particular profile. The following example demonstrates the process of creating a profile and granting permission.

**Creating a profile and granting permission**

```hcl
resource "turbot_profile" "test" {
  parent              = "tmod:@turbot/turbot#/"
  title               = "Snape"
  display_name        = "Severus Snape"
  email               = "severus.slytherin@hogwarts.com"
  given_name          = "Severus Snape"
  family_name         = "Snape"
  directory_pool_id   = "snapeseverus"
  status              = "Active"
  profile_id          = "170759063660234"
}

resource "turbot_grant" "test_grant" {
  resource = "tmod:@turbot/turbot#/"
  type     = "tmod:@turbot/aws#/permission/types/aws"
  level    = "tmod:@turbot/turbot-iam#/permission/levels/superuser"
  identity = turbot_profile.test.id
}
```
