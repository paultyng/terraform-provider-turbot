# turbot_folder

The `Turbot Folder` resource adds support for folders. Turbot folders define a top level hierarchy to arrange resources and their policies.

## Example Usage

**Creating Your First Folder**

```hcl
resource "turbot_folder" "test" {
  parent          = "tmod:@turbot/turbot#/"
  title           = "My Folder"
  description     = "My first test folder"
}
```

**Creating a Child Folder**

```hcl
resource "turbot_folder" "parent" {
  parent          = "tmod:@turbot/turbot#/"
  title           = "Parent Folder"
  description     = "This is my parent folder."
  tags = {
    "Name"        = "Provider Test"
    "Environment" = "foo"
  }
}

resource "turbot_folder" "child" {
  parent      = turbot_folder.parent.id
  title       = "Child Folder"
  description = "This is my child folder."
  tags = {
    "Name"        = "Provider Test"
    "Environment" = "foo"
  }
}
```
